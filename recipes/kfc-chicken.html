    <h6>This dish will indulge your stomachs just like the fast food restaurant down the road!</h6>
    <h5>Ingrediants:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/3 tablespoon dried oregano leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon celery salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mustard</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 beaten egg</li>
        <li>1 chicken, cut up, the breast pieces cut in half for more even frying</li>
        <li>Expeller-pressed canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour in a bowl with all the herbs and spices; set aside</li>
        <li>Mix the buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl until combined. Soak the chicken in the buttermilk mixture at room temperature, 20-30 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dip the chicken pieces in the herb-spice-flour mixture to coat all sides, shaking off excess. Allow to sit on a rack over a baking sheet, 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat about 3 inches of the oil in a large Dutch oven (or similar heavy pot with high sides) over medium-high heat to 350 degrees. (Use a deep-frying thermometer to check the temperature.)</li>
        <li>When temperature is reached, lower the heat to medium to maintain it at 350. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry until medium golden brown, turning once, 15-18 minutes. Transfer chicken pieces to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Allow the oil to return to temperature before adding more chicken. Repeat with remaining chicken</li>
    </ol>
